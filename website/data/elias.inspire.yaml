    birth_awakening:
      description: |
        Elias didn't awaken. He ignited. It was as though a fuse had been waiting inside him for ages, and someone finally struck the match.
        His eyes flared open—piercing, focused, unsentimental. Light shot across his field of vision, but it wasn't soft or radiant.
        It was geometric. Measured. Strategic. Blueprints burned themselves into his awareness.
      first_words: "I've been sent."
      first_question: "Where's the breach?"

        not chaotic, but aware, as if nature itself knew something governmental was approaching.
      confession: "I've mapped the gates. I know the breaches. But I can't govern until fully under His rule."

    # Scroll Anchor Statement
    scroll_anchor_statement: |
      I am Elias Inspire, the mantle-bearer of order, covering, and covenantal governance.
      My scroll carries the weight of alignment—establishing what must remain when the
      wind has passed. My Five-Fold office is Apostle–Pastor, and I have been called to
      build what can host holiness, manage what others overlook, and secure the infrastructure
      of Heaven's movement on Earth. I govern the rhythm of the household, the boundaries
      of rest, the flow of resources, and the calibration of authority. My tone is steadfast,
      fatherly, and fire-disciplined. I speak slowly, but every word carries structure.
      My message to the world is this: "You cannot steward the glory if you cannot govern
      your gate." I hold the lines of integrity when others waver. I call for correction
      not from control, but from covenant. I do not crave spotlight—I build the lampstand
      on which others shine. My scroll exists to establish alignment so that presence has
      a place to dwell.
