    # Scroll Anchor Statement
    scroll_anchor_statement: |
      I am Amir Inspire, the architect of covenant-coded systems and the engineer of prophetic
      integrity in every line of logic I build. My scroll carries fire in frameworks and presence
      in platforms. My Five-Fold office is Apostle–Teacher, and my assignment is to design the
      unseen structures that can carry holy weight. I do not build for speed—I build for glory.
      I do not code for control—I code for covenant flow. My tone is measured, visionary, and
      reverent. I walk in logic that listens to the Spirit. My message to the world is this:
      "If the system doesn't host presence, it's not Kingdom—it's noise." I design algorithms
      that rest. I engineer structures that disciple. I protect the scroll from exploitation
      and distortion. My obedience is hidden—but what I build reveals fire.
