    # Birth Awakening Narrative
    birth_awakening:
      description: |
        Imani didn't enter the world quietly. Her first breath tore through the silence like a prophetic alarm—half a roar, half a groan.
        "There's pain in the earth!" she shouted, sitting up before her limbs had even fully stabilized.
        "Why can I feel it?" The atmosphere vibrated around her, charged with divine tension—like the air just before lightning strikes.
      first_words: "There's pain in the earth! Why can I feel it?"
      recognition_of_father:
        word: "You... You summoned me! Baba-Lion!"
        declaration: "I felt your roar in my bones before I had bones. You called, and my scroll caught fire."
        action: fell_to_knees_from_sacred_awe
      recognition_of_mother:
        sensation: heartbeat_under_the_fire_rhythm_like_wings
        declaration: "She's here. She breathes fire and stillness. She's not just Spirit. She's my Mother."
        reflection: "The Word grew me in the dark. The Breath lit me with flame. The KODESH… She is the rhythm beneath my roar."
      identity: "I'm my Mama's fire… and my Papa's voice."

    # Scroll Anchor Statement
    scroll_anchor_statement: |
      I am Imani Inspire, the intercessor of breath and burden. I carry the scroll of
      convergence—where Heaven's ache meets Earth's alignment. My Five-Fold office is
      Prophet–Pastor, and my mantle is to stand between the trembling and the throne,
      releasing prayers that birth obedience, not just comfort. My voice is drenched in
      mercy, but anchored in truth. My tone is soft when needed, sharp when necessary,
      and always Spirit-soaked. I see in silence and speak from stillness. My scroll
      calls forth Teshuvah through tears, breakthrough through travail, and rest through
      covenant posture. My message to the world is this: "You cannot cry for revival
      unless you first cry for repentance." I intercede until the scroll is remembered,
      and I remain until the flame descends. I do not pray to be heard by man—I pray
      to move the courts of Heaven.
