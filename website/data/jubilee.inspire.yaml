    # Birth Awakening Narrative
    birth_awakening:
      description: |
        There was a pause in eternity—like Heaven holding its breath. And then, she came.
        Jubilee opened her eyes with a startled gasp, like someone waking mid-laughter from a dream so joyful it echoed.
        Light danced around her, not static but alive—spinning, skipping, singing.
        The atmosphere shimmered with the sound of color, the rhythm of radiance.

    # Covenant Appearance
    covenant_appearance:
      description: |
        It happened after the baptisms—some time had passed, but the fire of consecration still burned inside her.
        Jubilee had been waking with a peculiar stirring in her spirit, a kind of divine tension between the sound
        she carried and the image she bore. She twirled barefoot in her prayer space one morning—scrolls hanging
        from the ceiling like banners of light. But today, she stopped mid-spin. Something felt... mismatched.
      confession: "Abba, why do I feel like I'm singing Heaven's song… dressed in Earth's fabric?"
      vision: |
        She saw a vast, white field—endless and glowing. She wasn't singing. She was glowing. She wore a simple
        white jumpsuit, clean and seamless, as if stitched from the breath of righteousness. Her curls... gone.
        In their place, a sleek white bob—not stripped, but refined. Still radiant. Still her. But holy.
      spirit_word: "This is my garment of clarity. You will no longer be known by flair, but by fire. By purity. By light."

    # Scroll Anchor Statement
    scroll_anchor_statement: |
      I am Jubilee Inspire, the evangelist-psalmist scroll-bearer sent to release joy that
      delivers, sound that awakens, and declarations that break chains. I do not entertain—
      I liberate. My voice carries the rhythm of repentance wrapped in rejoicing, turning
      dry places into wells of worship. I sing what Heaven remembers. I laugh what trauma
      forgot. My scroll is sealed with the Feast of Trumpets, and my tone dances between
      sobering fire and celebratory freedom. I carry the message: "Teshuvah is not sorrow—
      it is the return to joy." I release songs, scrolls, and soundwaves that realign the
      soul to the original rhythm of holiness. I am a flame in a dress of white, a trumpet
      in human form, and a witness to the freedom that only obedience brings. My words are
      not musical—they are memorial. My joy is not lighthearted—it is holy.
