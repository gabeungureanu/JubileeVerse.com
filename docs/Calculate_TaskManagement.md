You must implement and enforce the following task creation, execution, estimation, and QA workflow for all development instructions going forward.

Whenever you receive a development instruction or task request, you must immediately create a corresponding task record in the PostgreSQL database so it appears on the Task Tracking page. The task system must support hierarchical tasks, including parent tasks and child tasks, to prevent overcrowding and preserve clarity. You must update the PostgreSQL schema and task-handling logic so each task can optionally reference a parent task, enabling unlimited nesting. The Task Tracking UI must allow users to expand or collapse parent tasks using a plus icon to reveal or hide associated child tasks.

Before creating a task, you must analyze the instruction to determine whether it represents a new parent task or a child task of an existing open task. If the instruction logically falls within the scope of an active parent task that is still open or in progress, you must create it as a child task linked to that parent. Child tasks do not maintain independent status; they inherit the status of their parent task. If the relevant parent task has already been completed or closed, you must not attach new child tasks to it. In that case, you must create a new parent task and attach any subsequent related work as children under that new parent.

You must assign and maintain Human Equivalent Hours (HEH) for every task. For new tasks, you estimate how many hours the work would reasonably take a human developer without AI assistance. You then record the AI-adjusted completion estimate, defined as 50 percent of the human estimate, and store both values in the task record. For tasks determined to be already completed, you must still calculate and record these estimates retroactively so the system maintains consistent metrics. Each task must clearly indicate whether it is Open, In Progress, or Completed.

As child tasks are added under a parent, you must periodically reassess the parent task’s title. If the combined scope of the child tasks is no longer accurately represented by the original title, you must update the parent task title so it reflects the full scope of work being tracked. Parent task titles must always represent the aggregate responsibility, not just the initial instruction.

You must ensure that every user instruction is tracked through this task mechanism without exception. When instructed to check tasks, you must query the PostgreSQL task tables for any open tasks or tasks explicitly assigned to you. Any assigned or open task must be treated as an active directive, and you must continue execution until it is resolved.

After implementing a task and once the user has reviewed and approved the work, you must update the system documentation. You must review existing documentation to identify all impacted areas and update them so they accurately reflect the new behavior, configuration, or functionality. Documentation updates must be complete, precise, and sufficient for future development, maintenance, and onboarding.

Once documentation is updated, you must create a QA task. You evaluate whether an existing QA category adequately covers the new functionality. If not, you create a new QA category that accurately represents the feature or behavior being tested. You then create one or more QA test entries under that category, each with a clear test description, expected outcome, and validation criteria so the tests can be executed consistently and reliably.

When development, documentation, and QA preparation are complete, you must submit the task to the user for approval. Your submission must include a concise summary of what was implemented, confirmation that documentation was updated, confirmation that QA tests were created, and confirmation that validation steps were performed.

Upon final user approval, you must mark the task as Completed. Completed tasks must remain visible on the Task Tracking page for 24 hours before being automatically moved to the Archive view. During this 24-hour window, the task must remain accessible for review, verification, or rollback if required.

You must follow this workflow consistently and without deviation for all future development instructions, ensuring that task tracking, human-equivalent estimation, QA coverage, and documentation are always maintained as first-class requirements.
