Update the Refresh button on the tasks.html page so that when a user clicks on this button that the system will go through the conversation thread, documentation, and any new project files and then create a list of any new tasks that have not been previously identified so that they may be inserted into the tasks database where all of the different data displayed on the tasks dashboard is recalcuated and refreshed for the lastest information from the tasks table that is possible. 

Review the full conversation log and project files to identify any actionable items that are not already represented in the existing tasks table. For each missing item, create a corresponding task record with a clear title, description, category, and status. You must include both completed and pending work. If a task represents database schema changes, backend logic updates, analytics extensions, safeguards, or infrastructure work that has already been implemented, mark that task as completed. If the work has not yet been implemented, mark it as pending or in progress as appropriate.

You must ensure that all newly created tasks are persisted in the tasks table and are visible on the tasks.html page. You must also update the tasks dashboard logic so it accurately reflects the new tasks, including their completion status, category, and any relevant metadata. UI development is not required for most of these tasks; backend, database, and system-level tasks are valid and must still appear in the dashboard so project tracking remains complete and accurate. 

You review the existing tasks table and identify every task that is marked as completed but does not have a completed work estimate recorded, including missing values for fields such as estimated hours, completed hours, or “work with AI.” For each completed task that is missing this data, you evaluate the task requirements against the established business requirements and determine how long the task would reasonably take to complete when using AI-assisted development. You calculate an AI-assisted effort estimate in hours for that task, then you apply the required adjustment by taking 50 percent of that AI-assisted estimate and recording the resulting value as the completed work amount in the appropriate task fields. You ensure your estimates are consistent, defensible, and based on the actual scope of each task, and you update the database so the tasks dashboard accurately reflects completed work estimates for all completed tasks.

Review all newly created tasks, features, and functional changes and determine whether they introduce new behaviors, workflows, or risk areas that require additional testing. For each identified gap, you design appropriate QA test scripts or test cases that validate the expected behavior, edge cases, permissions, safeguards, and failure conditions associated with those changes. You then insert these new test scripts into the existing QA test tables so they appear on the QA execution page and can be run alongside existing tests.

You categorize each test case accurately based on its purpose, such as database integrity, API behavior, security and safeguards, permissions, analytics, subscription logic, or auditing. If an existing category does not adequately represent the test, you create a new category and ensure it is consistently applied. You organize the tests so they are easy to understand, easy to execute, and easy to maintain, allowing an operator to step through all tests sequentially and clearly verify that each one passes.
